[DOWNLOAD WNR Bv0.0.01 FOR WINDOWS](https://github.com/orangesheep/wnr-desktop/archive/master.zip)


DISCLAIMER: The developer is not responsible for any misuse of this program.
WNR Desktop Player is a frontend that uses youtube-dl to download music from hundreds of sites.
WNR is freeware and if you paid for it other than donating to the project, you are getting ripped off.
WNR is very buggy and quite frankly my first desktop app. You can look at the source code, but only if you promise not to make fun of it.
WNR uses NW.JS, Chrome, Node.js, jQuery, ScreenFull.js, YouTube-dl, and Shortcut.exe, among other free projects. 
A full credits file will be included in the next version. 
--DIRECTIONS--

-Setup
Run "shortcut.bat" to create a shortcut in the same directory, or run "wnr.exe" in the WNR directory.

-Interface
Press the "innitialize player" button. This will have to be done on every re-launch of the software. I'm honestly not sure why.
There will be a grey box. That's where the album art (video thumbnails) will be loaded.
You can ignore that for now. Right under it are three buttons. The square is to toggle square view on youtube thumbnails. Not all music is optimized for this.
The second button is an arrow pointing to the top right, that is a fullscreen button. It's a little buggy.
The third button, the sun icon, is to toggle visibility of the album art.
The buttons on the top right of the window are standard but include a "DEV" button to open devtools and hack around.
This will subject you to the atrocious fragmented and hacky source code. I advise agaisnt this. 
The playlist is buggy. I recomend using an external player until I fix it.

-Downloading songs
Searches are done using Google Videos. WNR supports searches and youtube urls.
Type a search/ paste a URL then press "LOAD" to download it.
You should get a notification after the spinner disapears, and the file should appear in the playlist. 
Files are downloaded to a "files" directory in the same directory as the "WNR" folder.





This program was hacked-together in three days (collectively). Any advice or contribution is greatly appreciated!

I havent decided a license, but please give credit if you dare to use any of this atrocious code.
